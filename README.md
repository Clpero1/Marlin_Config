# AM8 Marlin Configuration

This config is for a stock ANET AM8 custom build that has been upgraded to use an Arduino 2560 Mega, RAMPS 1.4 (with 1/32 stepper driver jumpers), and a Raspberry Pi. Note: this config limits the bed size to 220x210 due to limitations with the default AM8 printed pieces.

I will keep this up to date as I make changes to the configuration but I may not always be up to date with the current Marlin version.
